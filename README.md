Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This project is a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts the risk of heart disease based on medical attributes. Users can input their health parameters (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, etc.), and the trained KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) model will classify whether the person is at high risk or low risk of heart disease.

Features

Interactive web interface using Streamlit

Collects user health details via sliders, inputs, and dropdowns

Uses scikit-learn with a pre-trained KNN model

Data preprocessing with scaling and one-hot encoding

Real-time prediction and risk assessment

User-friendly output with clear risk indication

Tech Stack
